# Hackathon
This repo contains my code I created for the Hackathon on day 1 of the Tech500 Programme.

It details my experimentation with using GitHub Copilot features to entirely code a video game from scratch.

The game in question is a simple endless platformer in which users may press 'E' to collect animals (which increases their score and lets out a sound). Their score is listed per animal, and users may restart or pause the game if they so wish. There also exists 'star' animals, which create a particle effect and a special sound, and it also increases the speed of the user.

The idea of this game was for users to be able to interact with NPC characters from my favourite series, and thus the idea of using animals as placeholders was born.
